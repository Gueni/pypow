# PyPow: Python Power Electronics

PyPow is a collection of Python programs for modeling and simulating electronics and power electronics. With PyPow, you can simulate circuits and analyze their behavior.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python 3.x on your system from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the PyPow repository using the "Clone or download" button on the [PyPow GitHub page](https://github.com/Gueni/pypow) or by running `git clone https://github.com/Gueni/pypow.git` in a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory of the Python program you want to run in a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the program by running `python program_name.py` in the terminal or command prompt.

## Features

PyPow provides the following features for modeling and simulating electronics and power electronics:

- Simulating circuits with resistors, capacitors, inductors, and diodes
- Analyzing the behavior of circuits
- Generating visualizations to help you understand and design circuits

## Examples

Here are some examples of what you can do with PyPow:

- Simulate an RLC circuit and generate a graph of its behavior.
- Simulate a buck converter circuit and analyze its efficiency.
- Simulate a PWM signal and generate a waveform.
